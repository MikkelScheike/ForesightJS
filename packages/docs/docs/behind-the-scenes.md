# Behind the Scenes

:::note
Reading this is not necessary to use the library; this is just for understanding how ForesightJS works.
:::

This section dives into the technical details of how ForesightJS works internally. If you're curious about the algorithms, architecture decisions, and implementation details that make user intent prediction possible, you've come to the right place.

## What You'll Find Here

### [Architecture & Structure](/docs/behind-the-scenes/architecture)
How ForesightJS is built using singleton patterns and observer architectures to efficiently track elements without performance overhead.

### [Element Lifecycle](/docs/behind-the-scenes/element-lifecycle)  
The journey of an element from registration through callback execution, reactivation timing, and cleanup.

### [Mouse & Keyboard Prediction](/docs/behind-the-scenes/mouse-keyboard)
The math and algorithms behind predicting mouse trajectories using linear extrapolation and the Liang-Barsky clipping algorithm, plus how keyboard navigation and scroll prediction work.

### [Touch Devices](/docs/behind-the-scenes/touch-devices)
How ForesightJS adapts its behavior for touch devices and mobile interactions.
